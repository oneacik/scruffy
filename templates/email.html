Hello.<br/><br/>

You received a friendly e-mail from SmartStuff.Me regarding project activation procedure.<br/>

If you made a mistake you can still deactivate project and start from beggining or leave for ever - life is brutal.<br/>
This doesn't really remove: <a href="http://89.74.141.168:8080/delete?{{ url }}"/>http://89.74.141.168:8080/delete?{{ url }} </a>
